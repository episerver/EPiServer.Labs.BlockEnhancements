> **_NOTE:_**  EPiServer.Labs.BlockEnhancements will be obsoleted soon. Most of its functionality was moved to the Core package.
One of the features which is to allow editors to create inlined Blocks list was released as part of 12.18.0 as described here https://world.optimizely.com/blogs/bartosz-sekula/dates/2023/1/official-list-property-support/
This is the last version which only contains a migration tool to move blocks to the new format inside ContentArea and run a little clean up of empty folders and usused blocks.

# Episerver Labs - Block Enhancements


### Please note
> Episerver Labs projects are meant to provide the developer community with pre-release features with the purpose of showcasing ongoing work and getting feedback in early stages of development.
>
> You should be aware that Labs are trials and not supported Episerver releases. While we hope you use them, there are a few things you should expect from each release:
> - Functionality may be added, removed, or changed.
> - Labs projects have not been through the same quality assurance process as the versioned products and, in some cases, may show unexpected behavior.
>   - The Episerver CMS UI team notes that:
>     - the scenarios in the Readme of each CMS Lab's repo will be verified and supported us
>     - the Labs add-on may or may not work with other add-ons, we are not testing them
>     - any such issues found, such as scenarios outside of the the Readme, can be fixed by the community by submitting a Pull Request on the Github repo
> - The software may not work on all environments.
>   - The Episerver CMS UI team notes that:
>     - Although it should work on base installations of CMS UI in Chrome and Firefox
> - There is no Episerver support; however, we will gratefully receive all feedback
>   - The Episerver CMS UI team notes that:
>     - Issues created on GitHub will be triaged, and if accepted, fixed by us
