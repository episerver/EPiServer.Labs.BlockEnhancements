> **_NOTE:_**  EPiServer.Labs.BlockEnhancements will be obsoleted soon. Most of its functionality was moved to the Core package.
One of the features which is to allow editors to create inlined Blocks list was released as part of 12.18.0 as described here https://world.optimizely.com/blogs/bartosz-sekula/dates/2023/1/official-list-property-support/
This is the last version which only contains a migration tool to move blocks to the new format inside ContentArea and run a little clean up of empty folders and usused blocks.
